# network-pruning-redundancy-removing

I tried some network pruning techniques, mainly learned from [A Kernel Redundancy Removing Policy for Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10748)

I used cifar-10 dataset and tried two network structures: squeezenet(shallow) and resnet(deep)

still need improvement for better performance
